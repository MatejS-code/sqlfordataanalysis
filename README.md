Project 1: Finding Top Traffic Drivers

As per project request the SQL query aims to retrieve and summarize data related to website sessions
by analyzing the sources and campaigns driving traffic to the site. 
It filters for sessions created before April 12, 2012, and groups the data 
by UTM source, UTM campaign, and HTTP referer. T
he query counts the number of distinct website session IDs for each group, 
providing insights into the most significant sources and campaigns. 
Finally, it orders the results by the number of sessions in descending order to highlight the top traffic drivers.
